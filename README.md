# Exploring Pydantic V2

### Lunch and Learn

### 2024

This is a guided, hands-on intro to [Pydantic v2](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/).
If you're a Pydantic pro, this isn't for you.

We'll walk through the Jupyter notebook [pydantic_v2_demo.ipynb](./pydantic_2_intro.ipynb) together.

Jupyter notebooks are awesome for this type of exploration because they allow for [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).

## Prerequisites

1. Watch Monday's kick-off video introduction from Adam if you missed it.
1. Install Python 3.11 or 3.12 in a virtual environment and activate it.
1. Install Pydantic v2 and JupyterLab in your virtual environment. `pip install -U pydantic jupyterlab`

## Context

Pydantic's upgrade from v1 and v2 has numerous breaking changes. See the Pydantic [migration guide](https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.6/migration/) for more information.

If you are interested in Prefect's internal transition to v2, join the #raft-pydantic-oss-v2 channel in Slack.
